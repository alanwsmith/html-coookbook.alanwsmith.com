      $DOCSCONTENT
      <p>
        I don't like the way lines 13 and 46 collide. Since this is a prototype,
        I'm not worrying about it. Going through iterations, that's something
        I'd address so it had an `...` in the middle or something.
      </p>
      $ESCAPED_a100
      <p>
        It's an array of arrays. The top level represents a code block. The
        arrays inside that correspond to sections of code (of which there can be
        one or more). And the numbers inside those identify the lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having gone through the process it feels like there's potential here but
        not with this specific approach. Mainly because it's annoying to have to
        change numbers whenever the source code changes. That's not not
        surprising, but I wanted to see what it was like.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's possible that tooling could help with the line shifts, but it feels
        like that would always be fragile. Another approach that's come to mind
        is pattern matching. For example, looking for function definitions and
        using those as the search keys on which place the content from the docs.
        There are tricks there and things are rarely perfect, but based on this
        experiment the matching approach has some real potential.
