  Note that because lines are all coming from the same source it's trivial to
  show line numbers that match the location of the full file. I'm not sure I'm
  going to like that in the long term, but my early impression is good.

  There's no need for the lines to be consequetive. Here's an example with a
  split.

--- { "lines": [[9,13], [46,50]] }
