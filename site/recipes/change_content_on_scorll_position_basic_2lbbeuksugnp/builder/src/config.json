    "Goal: This code shows how to trigger an event and make an update to a page with the Intersection Observer when content scrolls to a certain point.",
    "Goal: The demonstration area contains a &quot;ul&quot; with several &quot;li&quot; children. When each child element reaches the top of the demo box the display value changes to the show the id of the &quote;li&quot;",
    "The example below is built directly from the HTML and JavaScript code snippets that follow"
  ],
  "NOTES": [
    "The last element is given a specific height so it scrolls all the way to the top of the content area",
    "The top padding lets the switch happen just a little before the number appears at the top of the border box",
    "The scrolling area is created by setting `overflow-y` to `auto`",
    "The nextElementSibling call is used when the scroll is moving up since the observation is made on the element leaving the area"
