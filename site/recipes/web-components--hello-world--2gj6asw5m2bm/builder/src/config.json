    "DETAILS": [
        "This is a basic example 'Hello, World' example of web components. Some of the examples I've seen make it look much more complicated than it really is.",
        "The example below is built directly from the HTML and JavaScript code snippets that follow"
    ],

    "NOTES": [
        "I had to use both the open and close tags explictly. If I tried with the single tag version (i.e. `&lt;hello-component /&gt;) the rest of the content on the page disappeared",
        "Something to research: I'm assuming you have to load these before trying to use them with a tag so you can't put them after a DOM Loaded listener"
