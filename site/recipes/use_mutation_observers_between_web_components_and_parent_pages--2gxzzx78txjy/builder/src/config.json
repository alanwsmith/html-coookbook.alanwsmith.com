    "TITLE": "Using Mutation Observers To Setup Communication Between Web Components And Their Parent Page In Vanilla JS",
    "STATUS": "draft",
    "DESCRIPTION": "",
    "DETAILS": [
        "This is a basic example showing how to setup bi-directoinal communiation between a web component and elements on the parent page in vanilla js",
        "The top input range slider in the example is from the web component. The bottom one lives on the parent page directly. Moving one moves the other by passing a value through an 'amount' attribute on the component",
        "The code for the example is directly below it. More notes follow the snippets"
    ],
    "NOTES": [
        "First off. Yes. That's a long ass title for a page, but there's not many words to drop and get the point across",
        "This is vanilla js stuff. I'm not religious about that. Just exploring",
        "I expect there are other ways to do this. If you've got alternaties, please <a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheIdOfAlan&quot;>hit me up on twitter</a>"
    ],
    "TODOS": [
        "Do a full write up of the code (I made it as clear as I could, but there's still a lot and the process is convoluted)"
