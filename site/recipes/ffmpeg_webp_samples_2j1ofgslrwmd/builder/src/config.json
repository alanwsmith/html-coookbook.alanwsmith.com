        "I use '-vcodec', 'libwebp' for everything after the default baseline since it's literally designed for the conversion",
        "Setting `-lossless 0` had no effect from the baseline",
        "Setting `-lossless 1` turned it on and increased file size by 20x. Removing that from the outputs.",
        "-compression_level (0-6, default is 4) is: a quality/speed tradeoff. Higher values give better quality for a given size at the cost of increased encoding time. values go from 0 to 6. I'm not checking timings in this run, just the quality.",
        "Based on that description, I move compression_level to 6 for everything except the initial baselines",
        "Default `-quality` is 75",
        "The presets might be more pronounced on other content types"
