    "STATUS": "draft",
    "DESCRIPTION": "Goal: a form control that lets you pick from a selection by typing but only from the available selections",
    "DETAILS": [],
    "NOTES": [
        "Remove the previous 'Search' and 'Autocomplete' tests when this is running",
        "The reason for removing and adding the 'select' element (instead of just the options) is because of a behavior in safari where it doesn't respect resetting the position of the selected element on arrow movements",
        "I remove the placeholder text when you first click into the input field because it aways throws me when the text stays there on default forms"
    ],
    "TODOS": [
        "[ ] - Load data from child &lt;option&gt; elements",
        "[ ] - Clicking in opens the selection",
        "[ ] - Clicking out closes the selection",
        "[ ] - See if you make this off a selection if it can be use in forms directly"
