<p>
  This was an initail look at using the
  <a href="https://m-docs.org/">m-</a> (Mdash)
  <a href="https://m-docs.org/autocomplete">autocomplete</a> component. I was
  hoping to use it for
  <a href="https://fonts-and-colors.alanwsmith.com/">my font and color picker</a
  >. It has the same drawbacks as the other things I've seen. More details are
  down at the bottom in the notes
