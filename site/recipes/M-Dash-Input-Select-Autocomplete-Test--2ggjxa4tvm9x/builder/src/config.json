        "The docs had `defer` for the call to the .js file. When I did that I got an error updated the Autocomplete prototype",

        "Initial view: I'm not seeing a way to trigger events on just hitting enter. All I see is based of clicking an item",
        "It looks like you might be able to catch an 'enter' key and work off of that.",
        "Tabbig and using arrows to move down don't work for me in Safari or Chrome on the offical site. The means it's a non-starter for me"
