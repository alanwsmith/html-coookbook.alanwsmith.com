<h4>Goals</h4>

    item if there's no filter text
  </li>
  <li>
    [.] - Pressing the down arrow in the input field takes you to the second
    list item if there's a filter (thinking folks would hit enter if they wanted
    the first one
  </li>
  <li>[.] - Pressing escape in the input field takes you out and clear it.</li>
  <li>
    [.] - Clicking an item in the menu selects it, closes the menu, and returns
    the text to the placeholder

    second option

    filtering
  </li>

  <li>
    [.] - Reset selection in menu when opening the form so you don't hit the

  </li>
  <li>
    [.] - Fix issue with safari where it would keep track of how far down the
    last selection (even if you reset it) was which was undesireable. (Solution
    was to remove the element from the DOM and create a new one)
  </li>
  <li>[ ] - Provide for multiple instances on a page</li>
  <li>
    [ ] - When a selection is made, move the tab index so a press of tab goes
    back to the same menu

  <li>
    [ ] - Hitting enter on the text field when it's empty doesn't change place
    holder or selected value (right now it'll select the first item)
  </li>
