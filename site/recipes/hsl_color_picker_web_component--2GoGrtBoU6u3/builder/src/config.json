        "This is just the sliders. Showing a preview or doing something with the values is left to the implementation",
        "I switched the order of the sliders to something that makes more sense to me. I see the hue more as the foundation hence I put it at the bottom of the stack"
    ],
    "TODOS": [
        "[ ] - Setup to use arrow keys to bump the value for the last slider that was interacted with",
        "[ ] - Add alpha",
        "[ ] - Add second selection for color to put under alpha",
        "[ ] - Add debouce option to slow down sending event signal",
        "[ ] - See about using cookies to store values so they are the same on refresh, etc... Guessing sending an ID will be require"
