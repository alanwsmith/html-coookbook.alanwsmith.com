        "This is one way to center a &lt;pre&gt; tag inside another element"

    "NOTES": [
        "I applied background colors and padding outside that aren't shows in the CSS snippets. They aren't necessary for the centering. They just help show the relationships",
        "This approach uses `justtify-center` on the pre element itself. I think you can also use `justify-content` in the `#wrapper` style but I haven't tested that yet.",
        "There are also `align-self` and `align-content` that can be used to center/adjust things vertically that can also be looked at"
